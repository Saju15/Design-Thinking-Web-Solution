# Project Name: EduSlide Connect

### Overview:
EduSlide Connect is a web-based platform designed to address the issue of content-heavy and unengaging lecture slides prevalent in educational institutions. As a team of undergraduate students, we recognized the need to enhance the learning experience for students by improving the quality of lecture slides used by educators.

### Key Features of EduSlide Connect:

1.Freelancer Connection: Educators can connect with experienced freelancers possessing course-specific knowledge and graphic design skills to redesign their lecture slides.

2.Customized Slides: Freelancers will create customized and interactive lecture slides that cater to the unique needs of educators' students, ensuring enhanced engagement and comprehension.

3.Sorted Templates Library: The platform will offer a library of pre-designed templates for various subjects, empowering educators with ready-to-use engaging slide options.

4.User-Friendly Interface: EduSlide Connect will provide an easy-to-understand and use interface, allowing educators and freelancers to collaborate efficiently.

### Note: 
The report and presentation are based on our group research and design thinking process for the course BUSI2600 - Entrepreneurial Thinking. The development of EduSlide Connect is currently in progress.
